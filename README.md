# node-red-contrib-reusable-flows #

`node-red-contrib-reusable-flows` provides nodes that represent complete flows.

The desire for such a package arose from the need to be able to reuse existing flows without having to copy them and without having to spend a separate editor tab for each such flow.

The current goal is to have an alternative to "function" nodes which is backed by flows rather than JavaScript - although the "wiring compatibility" would allow to replace "reusable flow" nodes by (probably more efficient) "function" nodes should performance become relevant.

Three types of nodes are involved:

* `reusable-in` - starts a new "reusable flow"
* `reusable-out` - ends a "reusable flow" (multiple `reusable-out` nodes are allowed for any `reusable-in`)
* `reusable` - effectively "invokes" a reusable flow (i.e., the incoming `msg` is passed to the associated `reusable-in` and the `msg` read by the first connected `reusable-out` passed to the appropriate output of this `reusable` node)

### Alternatives ###

Node-RED (and its ecosystem) already offer some mechanisms to structure non-trivial flows:

* **Subflows** are very similar to "reusable flows" - but each subflow consumes its own tab in the editor which makes work with many subflows unmanageable
* **Link In** and **Link Out** nodes have their own raison d'Ãªtre but are more like "goto"s rather than invocations
* **Action Flows** (from [node-red-contrib-actionflows](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-actionflows)) are really powerful, put their name prefix matching scheme can lead to difficulat to find problems - and they do not support multiple outputs
* **Components** (from [node-red-contrib-components](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-components)) come quite close to what "reusable flows" aim to provide - but the association between "callers" and "callees" is based on the unique ids of the associated nodes which causes several problems
